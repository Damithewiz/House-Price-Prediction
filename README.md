# House-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict the median housing prices in California districts based on demographic and geographic data. By leveraging machine learning models, we seek to understand the factors influencing housing prices and predict them accurately for unseen data.

### Dataset

The dataset used is a simulated subset of the California Housing Prices dataset, featuring details such as median income, housing median age, total rooms, and population across different districts.

### Key Steps

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns and insights.
Feature Engineering: Enhancing the dataset with new features to improve model performance.
Modeling: Building and evaluating Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
Results

The initial models provide a baseline for predicting housing prices, with insights into areas for improvement and further exploration.
